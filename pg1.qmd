## About Me

Hello,

My name is Bhuvan Venkat, and I'm a graduate student at George Mason University pursuing Data Analytics Engineering. I completed my undergrad degree in electronics and computerÂ engineering. I've always been interested in sports statistics and statistical analysis. My long-term goal is to work for a reputed sports team as a data analyst.
